# nhelicenes

This repository contains the structures of [$n$]helicenes  computationally predicted for the paper "The effect of [$n$]-helicene length on crystal packing"

The energies and densities are in the `.dat` files within each subfolder which are calculated using the B86bPBE density functional and the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) dispersion model.
